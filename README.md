# Why
I was wondering if I could control my low-cost bluetooth lightstrips with my raspberry pi and after some research I found out it was totally possible.
I struggled so hard on understanding bluetooth specs, reverse engineering the bluetooth packets of my lightstrips and to be able to send the correct packets with my raspberry with nodejs that I decided to make a somehow "generic" lib that allows to create custom drivers.
